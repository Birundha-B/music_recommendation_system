🎶 Music Recommendation System (Lyrics-Based)
This project is a content-based music recommendation system that takes one song as input and suggests the top 5 most similar songs based on lyrics.

It is built using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as:

🧠 TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency) – to convert lyrics into numerical feature vectors

📐 Cosine Similarity – to compare lyrical similarity between songs

The system uses a cleaned subset of the Spotify Million Song Dataset, processes the text, calculates similarity scores, and returns the most relevant songs.
A simple, user-friendly web interface is built using Streamlit.

🚀 Features
Input: Select a song from the dataset

Output: Top 5 similar songs based on lyric content

Uses NLP instead of genre or artist
